# VBA-challenge

  This VBA script was written by me based on the material we covered in class.

  This script creates a macro in Excel to loop through all the stocks on each years worksheet and create a table with each stock's unique ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume. This macro then loops through the new table to create a table with the stocks with the greatest percent increase, percent decrease, and total volume. It then provides some basic and conditional formatting.
