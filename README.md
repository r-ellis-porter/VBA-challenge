# VBA Challenge: Stock Market Analysis

## Overview/Purpose

The VBA Challenge involves using VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. The goal is to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs key information such as ticker symbol, yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume. Additionally, the script should identify the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

## Important Findings

    Yearly Change: Calculated as the difference between the opening price at the beginning of a given year and the closing price at the end of that year.
    Percentage Change: Represents the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    Total Stock Volume: Indicates the total volume of stock traded for each ticker symbol.
    Greatest % Increase/Decrease: Identifies the stocks with the highest percentage increase and decrease in value, respectively.
    Greatest Total Volume: Determines the stock with the highest total volume traded.

## Summary

The VBA script efficiently analyzes stock market data across multiple worksheets, providing valuable insights into the performance of various stocks. It calculates key metrics and highlights positive and negative changes using conditional formatting, enhancing readability and interpretation of the results. By automating repetitive tasks, the script streamlines the analysis process and enables quick identification of top-performing stocks and trends.

## Technical Details

To run the code:

    Clone the repository named VBA-challenge.
    Open the VBA script file (multisheet_VBA_complete.vb) in Microsoft Excel.
    Ensure that the Excel workbook contains multiple worksheets with stock market data.
    Run the stocks_complete subroutine by clicking on the appropriate button or using the assigned shortcut key.
